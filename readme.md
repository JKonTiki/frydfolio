This is a basic website, most should be able to navigate with ease. There are two pages, each with a link to the other in their lower-right corners.

##Support and contact details

There does exist some loose pipe for initiatives that needed to be aborted rather than fleshed out to their full potential. Advice would not go unappreciated, please make contact via the info given on the page.

## Technologies Used

This web page was created using CSS and HTML. There are certainly some JQuery features that would work well if added.
